# NullValueRemoverToolpy
This tool can be used to remove the Null values (NaN values) in a CSV file for data preprocessing  ,It removes the entire row of the null value section

Data Preprocessing plays an important role in Machine Learning etc . Not all Datasets are in a correct format for training ML models ,Some Datasets will have NULL Sets 
To tackle this we can fill those Null values(NaN sets) with average value of the entire column or we can remove those Null rows 
So ,
I have created a simple python tool to remove those NULL Values/Empty Values in a CSV File
.
.
.
Will update this tool to fill missing values using linear method (mean values) In FUTURE .
